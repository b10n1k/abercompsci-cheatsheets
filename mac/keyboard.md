# Apple Keyboard


## Keyboard Shortcuts 
The cmd key is located to the left and right of the space bar. This is used to activate common commands such as Cut (Cmd+x), Copy (Cmd+y) and Paste (Cmd+v). The following table lists some common shortcut keys. As a general tip, use the Cmd key instead of the Ctrl key. 

Action | Shortcut
---| --- 
Close current window (or tab) | Cmd+w 
Copy | Cmd+c
Cut | Cmd+x
Emoji (dialog to select an emoji, if supported by the application) | Ctrl+Cmd+Space
Fonts Dialog (some applications, particularly those from Apple) | Cmd+t
Open | Cmd+o
Paste | Cmd+v
Preferences within an application | Cmd+,
Print | Cmd+p
Save | Cmd+s 
Switch application | Cmd+tab 
Tab (add a tab to some applications, e.g. Safari and Finder) | Cmd+t
Toggle current window in the application | Cmd+~

## # Key
Whilst this isn't visible on the iMac keyboard, simply type the Option+3 combination to insert the # character. The option key is often referred to as the alt key. It is to the left of the Cmd key. 

## Diacritics 
To insert a character with a diacritic, press and hold the character. For example, to add the character Ã© (e-acute), press and hold the e character. A popup selector will be displayed. Either select the number under the character, select the character with the mouse or use the left and right cursor keys and return to select.
